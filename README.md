# TYPING TEST

Simple starter project for using react.js this is a typing test, that colors the letter whether it is correct or incorrect
the WPM is dynamic and changes while you are typing.
the Words are randomly generated 50 words from a module called random-words.
the WPM is calculated by the keys typed/5/elapsed time, elapsed time since the user started typing and then i also track the amount of letters entered, and together that calculates the WPM
when the timer reaches 0 or the user finishes the words on the screen the user input is reset and the WPM is displayed. 
if the user wants to reset or generate a set of new words they can press the generate words button which resets everything and starts from scratch.
